          A Little About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
        I am a bio/pre-med student turn software engineer. In 2017, I graduated from Queens College with a bachelors in bio/pre-med. However, after working in healthcare, I realized I could put my talents to better use and I felt that tech was just the place for that. As a result, I attended The Grace Hopper Program through Fullstack Academy to help jumpstart my career as a software engineer. I have a diverse set of interests that make me a well rounded engineer, which includes  painting, make up, video games, fashion, and, of course, coding.
